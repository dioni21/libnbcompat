Releases
========

This directory contains build artifacts produced by `make rpm` (or by the
packaging pipeline).

Files you will typically find here:

- libnbcompat-<version>-<release>.<arch>.rpm
  - The main binary package (e.g., `libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm`).
  - Install with: `sudo dnf localinstall ./libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm` or
    `sudo rpm -Uvh --quiet ./libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm`.

- libnbcompat-<version>-<release>.src.rpm
  - The SRPM (source RPM) used to reproduce the build or to submit to COPR.
  - You can inspect it with `rpm -qip` or extract it with `rpm2cpio`.

Other related artifacts that may appear:

- libnbcompat-devel-*.rpm  (development headers/libs)
- libnbcompat-debuginfo-*.rpm (debuginfo packages)
- libnbcompat-debugsource-*.rpm (debugsource package)

Notes
-----
- The `Makefile` target `make rpm` builds binary RPMs (`rpmbuild -ba`) and
  copies the main binary RPM (excluding -devel and -debuginfo) and the SRPM
  into this directory.
- The `make srpm` target produces only the SRPM under your `rpmbuild/SRPMS`
  directory; `make copr` submits a build to COPR using the upstream tag URL.

Verification
------------
- To inspect an RPM:

  rpm -qip libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm

- To verify signatures (if present):

  rpm --checksig libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.x86_64.rpm

- To extract the SRPM (for examination):

  rpm2cpio libnbcompat-1.0.2-1.fc43.src.rpm | cpio -idmv

If you want this README to be copied or regenerated by `make rpm`, say so and
I will add that behavior to the `Makefile` as well.
